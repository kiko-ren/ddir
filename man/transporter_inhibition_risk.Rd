following fields are expected:
\itemize{
\item 'name' The perpetrator compound name
\item 'cyp' The UGT enzyme as (upper case) character.
\item 'ic50' The \eqn{IC_{50}} of the inhibition in Î¼M.
\item 'source' Optional source information as character.

\value{
A data frame.

\description{
Drug transporter inhibition risk
}
\details{
The relevant metric for the assessment of transporter interactions is
\eqn{R=[I]/K_i}. In in vitro transporter inhibition studies, \eqn{IC_{50}}
values are experimentally determined. Since the transporter substrate
concentration is usually kept very low in relation to \eqn{K_m} to
minimize passive permeation, \eqn{K_i = IC_{50}} can be assumed.

The relevant perpetrator concentrations \eqn{[I]} are:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{I_{gut}} for intestinal P-gp and BRCR
\item \eqn{I_{max,inlet,u}} for the hepatic basolateral transporters OCT1,
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3
\item \eqn{I_{max,ss,u}} for the renal basolateral transporters OAT1, OAT3 and
OCT2, as well as the apical transporters outside the intestinal mucosa, i.e.,
hepatic P-gp and BCRP, and MATE1, MATE2-k.
}

Note that the FDA and EMA guidelines differ in their definitions for the
thresholds for assumed clinically relevant effects.
